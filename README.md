# Emotion-Analysis-Project
**Facial Recognition & Emotion Detection — Deep Learning**

This project implements two deep learning models:

Facial Recognition — Identifies individuals using deep feature embeddings

Emotion Detection — Classifies facial expressions into 7 emotions:
Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Neutral, Disgust

**Project Highlights**

CNN Architectures for accurate emotion classification

Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 for improved accuracy and reduced training time

Data Augmentation for better generalization on unseen faces

Separate, modular training pipelines for recognition and emotion detection

Evaluated performance with accuracy metrics and confusion matrices

**Tech Stack**
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
scikit-learn

**Results**

Emotion Detection Accuracy: ~70% on FER2013 dataset
Recognition Accuracy: High precision on test set

**Datasets**

FER2013 (Kaggle) — for emotion classification

**Applications**

AI-driven security systems

Emotion-aware chatbots and assistants

Sentiment analytics for feedback systems
